#### Lists vs Tuples  

| List | Tuple | 
| ---- | ----- |
| There are some helpful functions in list. Such as append(),insert() | We donot have such functions in tuple |
| ---- | Tuples use less space |
| ---- | We can use tuples as dict keys |
| ---- | We can use **Named Tuples** as an alternative to objects |
| ---- | We can pass functions arguments as Tuples |
| Lists are homogeneous sequences, and have an order | Tuples are heterogeneous sequences, and have a structure |
| Lists are not hashable | Tuples are hashable (so, hashable = immutable + hash function) |
