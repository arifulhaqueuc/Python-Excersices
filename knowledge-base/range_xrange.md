#### Range vs Xrange
| range() | xrange() |
| --- | --- |
| range() produces a Python List | xrange() produces an xrange object |
| range generates a static list at run-time | xrange doesnot generate a static list at run-time |
| it consumes more memory | it is very memory efficient because it generates an object which is available for display by looping |
| present in Python 3 | removed in Python 3, was only available in Python 2 |
| range() is faster | --- |
