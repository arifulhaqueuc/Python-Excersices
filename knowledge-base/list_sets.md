#### Lists vs Sets

| List | Set | 
| ---- | ----- |
| Not unique | Unique |
| Ordered | Not Ordered |
| List supports append and indexing. So, we can access an item in list by its index | Set doesnot support indexing, so we cannot access an item in set by its index |
| ---- | Sets are implemented like a hash table (where has of the object is used to map the object) |
| lists can contain any type of object | Sets can only contain hashable items |
