Quick Questions

Ques: How do we convert a list to string and vice-versa ?
<br>Ans:
<br>We use list function to convert a string into a list. 
<pre>

</pre>
We use ```join()``` to convert a list into a string.
<pre>
m = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
p = " ".join(m)
print(p)

ab = "x".join(m)

Ques: What is negative index in Python

Ques: What is the **similarity** in list and tuple

<br>
[1] They are both heterogenous. Meaning that they can hold different types of values. 
<br>So, this is not worng in both list and tuple.
<pre>
abc = [1, 2, 3, 'av', 'xv']
def = (1, 2, 3, 'av', 'xv')
</pre>
[2] They are both ordered.
